# Pokemon-Python-Game
Created a Pokemon Game in Python. (2023)

This project is a Python-based text adventure game inspired by Pokémon mechanics, developed as part of CPS 109. It implements a turn-based combat system where the player selects one of four elemental classes—Fire, Water, Earth, or Air—and competes against an AI-controlled opponent. Core features include randomized attack damage, critical hits, class-based damage multipliers, healing with probabilistic bonuses, and a "pity system" to reduce repeated attack failures. The game also incorporates ASCII art for character representation, dynamic health bar visualization, and a high score system that records player performance with time tracking. Additionally, the program demonstrates structured menu navigation, robust input validation, and persistent data storage through external text files.
